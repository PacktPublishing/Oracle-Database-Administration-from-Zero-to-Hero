Hi every one,

In this section, we will start with Oracle Database Basic Administration.

Sepcifically, we will learn the following tasks:
start up and shut down database instances,
manage the initialization parameters,
retrieving from data dictionary views,
and using Oracle database documentation.

Those are basic tasks... every DBA must know how to perform them.

Let's get started.
