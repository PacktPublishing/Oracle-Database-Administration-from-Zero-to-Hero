-- Taking Backups in Oracle Databases
Hi everyone,
There is nothing worse than running a production database without a backup and recovery plan in place.
In this section, we will discuss about taking backups in Oracle databases.

We will learn how to use RMAN to take full and incremental backups in Oracle databases.

This section concentrates on non-CDB databases. Later in the course, we will covery the backup and recovery in CDB databases.

We'll see you guys in the next lecture.
